# Advanced Task Management System

## Project Idea
This project goes beyond a simple to-do list, incorporating features that demonstrate proficiency with React and modern web development practices.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement signup, login, and logout functionality
   - Use JWT for authentication

2. **Dashboard**
   - Display an overview of tasks, projects, and upcoming deadlines
   - Include data visualizations (e.g., charts showing task completion rates)

3. **Task Management**
   - CRUD operations for tasks
   - Drag-and-drop interface for task prioritization
   - Task categorization and tagging

4. **Project Management**
   - Group tasks into projects
   - Assign team members to projects

5. **Team Collaboration**
   - User profiles
   - Task assignment to team members
   - Comment system on tasks

6. **Time Tracking**
   - Built-in timer for tasks
   - Time logs and reports

7. **Calendar Integration**
   - View tasks and deadlines in a calendar format
   - Sync with external calendars (Google Calendar API)

8. **Notifications**
   - Email notifications for task assignments and deadlines
   - In-app notification system

9. **Search and Filter**
   - Advanced search functionality across tasks and projects
   - Multiple filter options (by date, priority, tags, etc.)

10. **Responsive Design**
    - Ensure the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Aspects to Focus On

1. **State Management**: Use Redux or Context API for global state management
2. **Routing**: Implement React Router for navigation
3. **Hooks**: Utilize various React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, custom hooks)
4. **API Integration**: Create a mock backend or use a BaaS like Firebase
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading
6. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
7. **Styling**: Use a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components or CSS modules
8. **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is accessible (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
9. **Animation**: Incorporate smooth transitions and animations
